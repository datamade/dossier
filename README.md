# dossier
Machine assisted dossiers

"dossier" tool for journalists and researchers backed by dedupe.io. In the complete version, the tool would have

* individual pages for people and organizations,
* with dedupe.io suggesting connections that can be reviewed and accepted by the user
* ability for the user to edit info about the entities
* ability for the user to add relations between people and organizations manually
* ability for the user to maintain notes
* permissioning systems for all of that.

I know this is the type of tool you've though of for a while. It would be great if we could find a time to chat to hear your thoughts and see if we can perhaps pool some resources.
