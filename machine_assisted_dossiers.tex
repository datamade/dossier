\begin{abstract}One of the great disappointments of big data is that so much
  of it is bad data. It is unreliable, ambiguous, and
  contradictory. Developing an accurate image of the world still
  requires discernment, sorting, and judgment.

  We are still are only beginning to building technologies that are
  complementary to these human capacities -- allowing for
  scale.  In this paper, we present the capabilities we believe an
  adequate knowledge system must have, drawing heavily from the field
  of genealogy and our own work modeling international security forces
  and campaign finance.
